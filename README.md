# 🚀 **Astro Webapp Template**:

Documentation for this isn't exceptionally deep, as I expect myself to be the only user of this repo. If you'd like to start from this repo yourself, however, Astro provides great documentation [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

Luckily, Astro provides magical support for most frameworks and libraries anyone might want to use. Unlike Webpack, Astro really does most of the work for you.
